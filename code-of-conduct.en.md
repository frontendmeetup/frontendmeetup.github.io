## Purpose of this document

Frontend Meetup Budapest is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community meetup experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup-related venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.

Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup and future meetups at the discretion of the organizers.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. If you see or hear someone do something, that might violate this Code of Conduct, please report it.

You can make a personal report by:

 - Contacting a staff member
 - Twitter direct messages: [our DMs on twitter are always open](https://twitter.com/frontendmeetup)
 - Email - but it might take up a few hours or a day before we can respond on email during or after the event.
 
## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup and future events.

We expect participants to follow these rules at meetup and workshop venues and meetup-related social events.

## Harassment

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

 - Verbal or written comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion
 - Sexual images in public spaces
 - Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
 - Harassing photography or recording
 - Sustained disruption of talks or other events
 - Inappropriate physical contact
 - Unwelcome sexual attention
 - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

## Inclusive language

In our commitment to a harassment-free and inclusive environment we strongly believe it's important to pay attention to harmful language patterns.

### Ableism

Words like "crazy", "dumb", "insane" or "lame" are examples of ableist language, devaluating people who have physical or mental disabilities. Its appearance often stems not from any intentional desire to offend, but from our innate sense of what it means to be normal. These words can be avoided by using more fitting, clearer descriptions of what we want to communicate.

To find out more about ableism and replacement terms please read [this guide](http://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html).

### Sexism

Using gendered terms like "dude" or "guys" to address a mixed-gendered group of people contributes to furthering exclusion of underrepresented individuals. We strongly advise avoiding gendered pronouns as well as gendered terms.
